# A more structured approach to data journalism through the usage of R Notebooks

## Presentation held at R Usergroup Hamburg Meetup 07.12.2017

This repository contains a real-life example on how I use R Notebooks for visualization prototyping and communiction with other editors. The notebook was used to prepare socio-demographics analyses of party strongholds for the 2017 German federal election.  
It was created while working on a deadline and was never meant for publication. You can try and open the .Rmd-file and rerun the code on your machine, but the notebook wasn't written with reproducibility in mind. Take a look at the .html-file to see a rendered notebook with the preliminary results that were used to discuss where to go with this approch and how to structure the story.

The final article that's been published with a later version of this notebook can be found [here](http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/bundestagswahl-2017-kaum-auslaender-in-afd-hochburgen-a-1169727.html).

The data used in this example was published by the German Federal Election Commissioner and can be found [here](https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahlen/2013/strukturdaten.html).
